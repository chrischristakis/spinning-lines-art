# Spinning lines art
A canvas art project with spinning lines.

This was created by rotating a bunch of lines, and making each line's rotation be the sum of it's 9 adjacent neighbours.
Some lines are 'locked', meaning they are static and no forces apply to them (they rotate at a set speed) and influence
patterns in the grid.
